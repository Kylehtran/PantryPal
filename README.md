## Setup

Please clone the `cse-110-project-team-11 main` repository with `git clone`, using the HTTPS link

When you import this repository, make sure to make the repository **private**.

After navigating to the project's `java` folder (should be found in `cse-110-project-team-11/src/main/java`), you should see the `UI.java` file. This is the main file that we are using for the PantryPal app.

## Running the App
### Visual Studio Code 
Try to run the app, by pressing the UI.java launch button.\

## Common issues
### Make sure that the launch.json has the correct directory
Our current working app UI.java uses MacOS `aarch64` SDK version. Make sure that the launch.json file in the workspace has the proper build. You can check here:

Note: `lib` refers to the _relative_ path, where we access the library folder in the workspace (`cse-110-project-team-11/lib`).

If the relative path does not work, we can try to the the absolute path. You can download the JavaFX package [here](https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/)

From here, we will change the configuration in the `launch.json`. 
1. Get the working directory of the JavaFX folder.
2. Copy a `lib` file and replace the lib file from the project.
3. Then copy path of the lib file to enter it into the launch.json directory.

4. Once you save launch.json after changing directory then your launch should work.
